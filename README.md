# CLASSIFICATION-AND-OUTLIER-DETECTION-
This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify messages as spam or ham (non-spam) using text content. The model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. Visual tools like confusion matrix heatmaps and word clouds help interpret model performance and message patterns.
